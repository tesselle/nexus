Exploration and analysis of compositional data in the framework of @aitchison1986. This package provides tools for chemical fingerprinting and source tracking of ancient materials.

**Initial development is in progress.**

## Installation

You can install the released version of **nexus** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r cran-installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("nexus")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r gh-installation, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tesselle/nexus")
```

## Usage

```{r packages}
## Load the package
library(nexus)
```

**nexus** provides a set of S4 classes that represent different special types of matrix.

* `CompositionMatrix` represents relative frequency data (composition data),
* `LogRatio` represents log-ratio matrix.

*It assumes that you keep your data tidy*: each variable must be saved in its own column and each observation (sample) must be saved in its own row.

These new classes are of simple use as they inherit from base `matrix`:
  
```{r create}
## Coerce to compositonal data
data("hongite")
coda <- as_composition(hongite)
```

The `CompositionMatrix` and `LogRatio` classes have special slots:
  
* `samples` for replicated measurements/observation,
* `groups` to group data by site/area.

When coercing a `data.frame` to a `CompositionMatrix` object, an attempt is made to automatically assign values to these slots by mapping column names. This behavior can be disabled by setting `options(arkhe.autodetect = FALSE)`.

```{r group}
X <- matrix(data = sample(0:10, 75, TRUE), nrow = 15, ncol = 5)
X <- as.data.frame(X)
X$samples <- sample(c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"), 15, TRUE)
X$groups <- sample(c("A", "B", "C"), 15, TRUE)

## Coerce to a count matrix
Y <- as_composition(X)

## Get groups
get_samples(Y)

## Get groups
get_groups(Y)
```
