Exploration and analysis of compositional data in the framework of @aitchison1986. This package provides tools for chemical fingerprinting and source tracking of ancient materials.

**Initial development is in progress.**

## Installation

You can install the released version of **nexus** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r cran-installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("nexus")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r gh-installation, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tesselle/nexus")
```

## Usage

```{r packages}
## Load the package
library(nexus)
```

**nexus** provides a set of S4 classes that represent different special types of matrix. The most basic class represents a compositional data matrix, i.e. quantitative (nonnegative) descriptions of the parts of some whole, carrying relative, rather than absolute, information [@aitchison1986].

*It assumes that you keep your data tidy*: each variable must be saved in its own column and each observation (sample) must be saved in its own row.

These new classes are of simple use as they inherit from base `matrix`:
  
```{r create}
## Mineral compositions of rock specimens
data("hongite")
head(hongite)

## Coerce to compositional data
coda <- as_composition(hongite)
head(coda)
```

The `CompositionMatrix` class has special slots (see `vignette("manual")`):
  
* `samples` for repeated measurements/observation,
* `groups` to group data by site/area.

When coercing a `data.frame` to a `CompositionMatrix` object, an attempt is made to automatically assign values to these slots by mapping column names. This behavior can be disabled by setting `options(nexus.autodetect = FALSE)`.

```{r group}
## Create a data.frame
X <- data.frame(
  samples = c("A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "B", "C", "C", "C"),
  groups = c("X", "X", "X", "X", "X", "X", "Y", "Y", "Y"),
  Ca = c(7.72, 7.32, 3.11, 7.19, 7.41, 5, 4.18, 1, 4.51),
  Fe = c(6.12, 5.88, 5.12, 6.18, 6.02, 7.14, 5.25, 5.28, 5.72),
  Na = c(0.97, 1.59, 1.25, 0.86, 0.76, 0.51, 0.75, 0.52, 0.56)
)

## Coerce to a compositional matrix
Y <- as_composition(X)

## Get samples
get_samples(Y)

## Get groups
get_groups(Y)
```
